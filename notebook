# notebook - A script to make notes inside terminal
# Licensed under the MIT License
# Copyright (c) 2020 Rekechynsky Dmytro aka DMENT

# NOTE: notebook saves notes on the principle
# "one note - one line", so consider the terms
# "note" and "line" the same.



##### Initialization


# Notes are saved in the file ~/.local_notes
# Backup is located in the file ~/.local_notes_backup
# ~/.local_notes_temp is temporary file, which is
# used for performing operations of deleting lines.

filename=~/.local_notes;
filename_temp=~/.local_notes_temp;
filename_backup=~/.local_notes_backup;

# In order to avoid performing operations at non-existent
# file it's good to create the file.

file_exists=$( ls -A ~/ | grep '.local_notes' );

if [[ -z $file_exists ]];
then
    touch $filename;
fi

# If temporary file exists, remove it.
# Even it is deleted every time after performing some
# operations, it helps to avoid corruptions.

file_temp_exists=$( ls -A ~/ | grep '.local_notes_temp' );

if [[ -n $file_temp_exists ]];
then
    rm $filename_temp;
fi

# This variable is needed only for backup operations.

file_backup_exists=$( ls -A ~/ | grep '.local_notes_backup' );



##### Colors


# notebook has feature to paint notes with
# different colors. This feature is provided
# easily thanks to regular expressions (REGEXP).

# It's not "white color" REGEXP, but "clear
# all formats were set before"

white="\e[0m";

red="\e[31m";
green="\e[32m";
yellow="\e[33m";
blue="\e[34m";
magenta="\e[35m";
cyan="\e[36m";



##### Variables


# This variable holds text of note, which
# is going to be added.

note=;

# This variable is used for checking for
# odd arguments.

odd_par=;

# For correct number checking.

to_check=;

# Number of note to remove.

to_remove=;

# If you want to remove couple of lines at once,
# this variable holds last number of note to remove.

remove_till=;

# Holds color value. The default is white.

color=$white;

# The count of all the notes.

line_count=$( wc -l $filename | awk '{ print $1 }' );



##### Functions


# write_notes() adds a note to file in the format:
# LINE_NUMBER. REGEXP_SET_COLOR NOTE REGEXP_CLEAR_FORMAT
# But you can't add empty note.

write_notes()

# 1) Check $to_remove to be correct argument
# 2) Create temporary file
# 3) Coprying the lines from original to temporary file
#    through iteration (from the first to the line before line
#    that must be removed).
# 4) Continue copying lines from the new point.
#    The new point is:
#    - line after $remove_till
#    - or, if $remove_till is empty, line after $to_remove
# 5) Delete original file, rename temporary file as the original.
